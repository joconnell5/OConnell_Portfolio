### Projects

#### Course Grade Calculator
 - This project is a grade calculator in Microsoft excel. This grade calculator allows the user to enter a set of grades as well as their designated weight to calculate the overall grade in the class. The calculator provides the letter grade as well as a graph displaying the data.
 - [insert project 1 screenshot here]
 - Initial project idea: 
The problem I set out to solve with this project was having to manually calculate your grade in a class. This was a problem that needed to be solved because manually calculating to figure out your grade in individual classes is a lengthy process and more work than it has to be. 
 - Tools I used: 
This project was done in Microsoft Excel. Tools I used to complete this project were IF and SUM statements, as well as Excels graph feature. 
 - Challenges I faced:
A challenge I faced was not being able to get the graph to show the data correctly. I overcame this obstacle through trial and error by changing different things until it worked.
 - Result:
I set out to make a chart where I would be able to input grades for a class and their weight and have the chart calculate the final grade I would receive for the class. I was able to achieve this using SUM and IF statements. An improvement I would like to make if I had a chance to take it further would be to add additional grades into the chart.

#### Side Hustle Inventory Calculator
 - This project was a side hustle inventory and profit calculator I made in Excel. The table shows the quantity of items as well as their profit and whether their profit margin should be increased or not.
 - [insert project 2 screenshot here]
 - Initial project idea: 
The problem I set out to solve was determining whether items in my inventory should have their profit margin increased or not. This was a problem that needed to be solved because it’s important for a business to know whether an item is being sold at the right price.
 - Tools I used: 
I made this project in Microsoft Excel. The tools I used to complete this project were IF, SUM, and VLOOKUP functions in Microsoft excel. As well I used Excels cell customization options to color code the data in the chart. 
 - Challenges I faced:
I challenge I faced was coming up with the data for the buying prices and selling prices of the items. I overcame this obstacle by looking up the prices that similar items have been bought and sold for.
 - Other Resources: 
A resource I used was eBay to see prices in which items were being sold for. 
 - Result:
I set out to create a table showing the inventory of products in a business, as well as calculating their profit margins and determining if their selling price should be increased. If I had a chance to take this project further I would try changing the quantity of some items to multiple.

#### BiWeekly Time Sheet
 - This project is a biweekly time sheet that keeps track of hours worked during the week at a job. 
 - [insert project 3 screenshot here]
 - Initial project idea:  
The problem I set out to solve was to organize and manage my time. This was a problem that needed to be solved because it’s important to have time management, especially when working a job. 
 - Tools I used: 
The tools I used in completing this project were the Excel number format and SUM features.
 - Challenges I faced:
I challenge I faced was formatting the numbers into a time format. I overcame this obstacle by changing the numbers until they displayed properly in the Excel time format. 
 - Result:
I set out to make an effective way of tracking my hours worked at a job and improve my time management. If I had the chance to take this further I would improve the specificness of the times to be clearer.
